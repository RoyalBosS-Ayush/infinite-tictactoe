## Introduction
**Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe** is a unique twist on the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game, built using Kotlin for Android. In this version, the game board is dynamic, and as players fill in the cells, the earliest moves begin to fade away, ensuring the game never ends in a draw. The game also features engaging sound effects for an immersive experience.

## Features
- **Dynamic Board:** Once six places are filled, the first placed cell dims. When the seventh place is filled, the dimmed cell is removed, allowing continuous gameplay.
- **Sound Effects:** Custom sound effects enhance gameplay, making every move and action feel impactful.
- **No Draws:** The game's design ensures that a draw is impossible, keeping the game competitive and engaging.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the idea of creating a never-ending Tic-Tac-Toe game that eliminates the possibility of a draw by dynamically removing older moves. The combination of an infinite board and sound effects adds a new dimension to the classic game.
